# Hotel-Management-System
The Hotel Management Database is designed to efficiently manage various aspects of a hotel's operations using PostgreSQL as the database management system. It includes tables to store information related to guests, employees, rooms, reservations, cancellations, tickets, reclamations and payments. This database recreates the way of arranging the data with a real example.
